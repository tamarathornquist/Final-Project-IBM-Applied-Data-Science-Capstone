# Final-Project-IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

Work in progress

In the final project for the Coursera Course IBM  Applied Data Science Capstone I analyze different boroughs in Stockholm region. I use the Nominatim tool to find the coordinates for Stockholm and the Folium library to display the map of Stockholm. I scrap the web using the BeautifulSoup library to construct a list of boroughs in Stockholm county. I use .geojson file to assign boroughs' coordinates. Then, I send RESTful API calls to Foursquare to collect information on different venues and amenities in each boroughs. Further, I cluster boroughs by venue and amenities occurrence using different clustering methods.
